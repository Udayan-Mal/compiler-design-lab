# Compiler Design Lab

This repository contains various C programs and Lex scripts for compiler design tasks, including lexeme checking and lexical analysis. 
The programs demonstrate the fundamentals of compilers, including parsing, regular expressions, and finite automata. 
These programs are part of the Compiler Design Lab for academic purposes.
